I always wanted to blog which has been on my procrastination list for more than 5 years and now I'm finally trying to blog... So i guess this is my first attemt on blogging.

I always wanted to put my two cents out there on one of the most debated topics on possibly the history of humankind, "Can money buy you happiness". We even have entire religion bassed off of this concept. 

As someone who came from a very humble background, I directly correlate money with happiness. And for the most part money has been the most crucial part of the change in the quality of my life. It enabled me to become more confident, to not care about small nuiances and mistakes which can be som=lved by throwing some money at it and most important of them all... Freedom!

Let me explain. I come from a family where my parents were soo financially stupid that even the 10 year old me could point out what they were doing wrong and what should've been done...
